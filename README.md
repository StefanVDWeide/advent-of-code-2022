# The Advent of Code 2022

## Description
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

## This Repo
This year I've chosen to do the entire Advent Calendar (or atleast until things get too complex) in `Rust`. It's a great language with interesting features and what better way to improve your skills than actually using it to solve programming puzzles.

## Structure
There is one `main.rs` file under `/src` in which the individual solutions for each day will imported from their respective folders. The instructions and input will also be placed in the day folders.
